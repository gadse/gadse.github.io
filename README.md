# Greetings, Humanoid Life Form!
You're probably reading this because you've been given this URL by someone you know. Here I'll try to update the most important facts for our RPG group's next session(s). In between regular sessions, we often have "one-shots". That's a short adventure that can be played in one sitting and that's not connected to our regular campaigns. It's a great opportunity for aspiring DMs to test out whether GMing is something fun for them, or for players to get to play a completely different character.

This page is intended for summarizing and looking up stuff. For questions like "when's our next session again?". Actual communication and definition of dates is done personally or via telegram, e-mail, coffee talks, etc.

- **Last session in "one" sentence:** Our heroes attended a meeting in Bryn Shander where Harshang asked them to accompany him on his journey to the Eye of the Allfather, an ancient giant Temple where he wants to find out more about what the Giant Lords are up to. The party then (after staying in the City for to addidional days so Sorion could pick up his now reinforced spellbook) teleported to Yartar, where Tarhun was able to reclaim his staff. In the evening, Antares managed to aquire information on the whereabouts of Harthos Zymorvens stolen Greataxe. However, someone (or something ^^) tried to follow them on the way the back to the Harper's Mansion. They managed to ~flee~ retreat, and decided to continue their journey to Everlund.
