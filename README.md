# Greetings, Humanoid Life Form!
You're probably reading this because you've been given this URL by someone you know. Here I'll try to update the most important facts for our RPG group's next session(s). In between regular sessions, we often have "one-shots". That's a short adventure that can be played in one sitting and that's not connected to our regular campaigns. It's a great opportunity for aspiring DMs to test out whether GMing is something fun for them, or for players to get to play a completely different character.

This page is intended for summarizing and looking up stuff. For questions like "when's our next session again?". Actual communication and definition of dates is done personally or via telegram, e-mail, coffee talks, etc.


# Regular Campaign Sessions

- **Current In-Game Date:** 25th Flamerule, 1491 DR
- **Last session in "one" sentence:** After talking about their future plans with Krowen Valharrow, our heroes decided to return to Yartar in order to do some shopping, an to visit the Wink & Kiss tavern, where they wanted to cash in the "morally flexible" favor granted by Tamalin Zoar. While Tarhun and Sorion talked to Cio Yu (the local leader of Yartars thieves's guild), Vorus decided to scout ahead, and in the end got seperated from the party. Tarhun tried to set up a distraction, triggering a fireball trap in the process. Despite angering a significant part of the thieve's guild, Tarhun and Sorion made it out of the tavern alive. After defeating both two flying swords and two suits of animated armor, Vorus decided to loot the guilds treasury before making his way back out.
