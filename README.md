# Greetings, Humanoid Life Form!
You're probably reading this because you've been given this URL by someone you know. Here I'll try to update the most important facts for our RPG group's next session(s). In between regular sessions, we often have "one-shots". That's a short adventure that can be played in one sitting and that's not connected to our regular campaigns. It's a great opportunity for aspiring DMs to test out whether GMing is something fun for them, or for players to get to play a completely different character.

This page is intended for summarizing and looking up stuff. For questions like "when's our next session again?". Actual communication and definition of dates is done personally or via telegram, e-mail, coffee talks, etc.

- **Last session in "one" sentence:** Our heroes set an ambush on a party of hobgoblins, . The Dwarf they had with them turned out to be a disguides hobgoblin, and a battle between our heroes and the hobgoblins ensued. They managed to intimidate the single surviving hobgoblin into "sharing" his knowledge, and found out that the hobgoblins they just fought were a distraction. Supposedly, two hobgoblins disguised as humans are travelling to mirabar (taking a more direct path through the forest), where they are supposed to turn in Worvil Forkbeard for 5000 Gold Pieces.
