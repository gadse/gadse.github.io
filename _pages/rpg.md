Greetings, Humanoid Life Form! You're probably reading this because you've been given this URL by someone you know.

Here, I'll try to update the most important facts for our RPG group's next session(s). In between regular sessions, we often have "one-shots". That's a short adventure that can be played in one sitting and that's not connected to our regular campaigns. It's a great opportunity for aspiring DMs to test out whether GMing is something fun for them, or for players to get to play a completely different character.

This page is intended for summarizing and looking up stuff. For questions like "when's our next session again?". Actual communication and definition of dates is done personally or via telegram, e-mail, coffee talks, etc.

## Code of Conduct
Be nice.
Be considerate.
Be dependable.
